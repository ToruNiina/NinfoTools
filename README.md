##CafeMol ninfo tool

I wrote this out of necessity.

liberica is a name of one of the coffee trees.

###Usage

splitter splits all in one style ninfo file to one by one style ninfo files.

`./nsplit <filename>.ninfo [-sim N(1 by default)]`

`outputs <filename>_iunit1_iunit2.ninfo and native_info_simN.inp`

this inp file contains only <<<<native_info_simN block for one by one style.
